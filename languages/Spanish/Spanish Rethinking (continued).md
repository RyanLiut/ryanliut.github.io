# Spanish Rethinking (continued)

1. Why words ending with /s//x/ don't change when they are pural? I think it is about its pronunciations.

   That's an example in which pronunciation affects the form and meaning.

   Not like English, /es/ may sound /s/ with /e/ silent. So it is a convenient way to utter this.
