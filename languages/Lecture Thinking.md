# Lecture Thinking

## May 27th

I always hold a doubtful but sometimes mysteriously confident belief to deep learning, a statistical way to study AI. And every time when I think about it, one unsolved, lasting, basic question hovers over my mind: what is exactly "intelligence"? Is memorizing intelligent? If so, why computer or deep learning can't referred to "intelligent" since they can memorize a ton of things. Computer could memorize lots of pictures - millions of pictures, sentences - even the large wikipedia or the all works Shakespeare have created. Computer could memorize almost all language pronunciations. Even the strong (and difficult for me to learn it for 3-4 months) "r" in Spanish:) And If not, does that mean we can't say a person acquiring lots of languages is intelligent. A person memorizing almost all the poems of Ancient China does not worth to be "intelligent"? And the subject math and English have basic difference, that latter is not even using too much brain? I don't know.

According to the book [*language instinct*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_Instinct) of [Steven Pinker](https://stevenpinker.com/) language is more like an instinct in some ways like sleeping, sucking milk. And why the quote from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/speech-and-language-the-crown-jewel-of-ai-with-dr-xuedong-huang/):

> So, if you look at the humans, it is speech and language that set us apart from other animals. For artificial intelligence, speech and language would drive the evolution of AI, just like it did to humans. That’s why it’s the crown jewel of AI.

Suppose, a new person don't use any language like the current mature object recognizing system. He could recognize this one belongs to some class (which labels "flower" or "花" or "❀" or "flor" or whatever). Does he have to know what it is called, what it is used for, how many days it isn't watered? Like the German rural old woman coming to the foreign city curious why it is a *blume* but people call it "*flower*"? If language can be decoupled from the image, why can't memory-based deep learning can't be called "intelligent"?

## About the lecture

1. **https://ttv.cn/archives/9955**
2. I don't know the degree of the combination of linguistics and deep learning but at least it can be an example including [BFSU](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wC3gnTJv2FCG8IPn9aQe0Q). And there are some combining and interesting directions.
3. 人工智能的诗和远方
4. About the kinds of imaginations and relations happen in our brain when we meet one certain thing, what about the other way? When we learn a new language what about not emphasizing the semantics of a word just using the "images" and "sound" to stimulate some mysterious neurons? that is not very "intelligent"?
